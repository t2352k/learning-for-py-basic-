The Repo is the integrated files when I learn py through GPT tools and the idea was taught in a vedio from bilibili:

I was too eager to finish the target so I don't learn much after my 6days (the last for learning how to use git) .However, it is by no
means a good method for us to learn a new tools .

AI can give you a schedule according to how much time u want to spend, what you want to learn . And follow the whole schedule, I ensure
u will learn a lot.

Here are the prompts you can find them in "plan 4 3weeks.md":

you should begin with:
  我想学习[ sth. ]，请按照二八法则（80-20）制定一个全面的学习计划，重点关注能让我开始构建项目的20%的核心概念。请将计划按周安排，总计
  [how much time you want to spend]。每周涵盖特定的学习主题。
在这完成在完成这三周的核心学习后，请推荐五个难度递增的项目，（从入门到进阶），帮助我应用和拓展Python的知识。对于每个项目请提供简要描述并列出他它将帮助强化的关键概念。
确保计划详细到足以让初学者跟随，同时也要有足够的挑战性，来培养独立思考和解决问题的能力

for specific content you want to learn:
  我在学习[sth.]中的[specific point you want to know]。属性与方法。请提供1、简明扼要的解释它，包括其用途和常见使用场景。2、一个演示它的简单代码事例
3、初学者关于它常见的三个错误或者误解以及如何避免他们。4、两个它特别有用的实际应用场景或举例
5、三个难度递进的练习题帮助我练习使用它，请只提供题目描述，不要提供答案。在提供以上信息后，请向我提出一个关于它的发人深省的问题，引导我更深入的思考他的应用方法

Conclusion:
  I think the most important point is that AI plans a specific schedule for me, I can follow it to learn points in py sequently.
  It help me to manage my time, avoiding I wasting my time aimless. Since I want to learn sth, I'll find docunments for Internet.
  From my perspective, it's hard to begin, as well as harder to persevere. So do not hesitate, set your goal, and begin.
